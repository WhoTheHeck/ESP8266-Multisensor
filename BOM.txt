# BOM

1x NodeMCU v2
1x SHT31
1x CCS811
1x BME280
1x AM312
1x WS2812B 1-Bit Module - RGB LED
1x PCB
1x Case top (3D printed)
1x Case bottom (3D printed)
1x JST assembly guide (3d printed)
3x 3 pin JST
2x fresnel lenses (type 13120) (1 as LED diffusor, 1 as lightsensor cover)
copper wire, solder tools

optional:
3x pinheader-contacts (alternatively solderbridge on PCB)

under evaluation: fresnel lenses.
type 023115 could potentially be a replacement for AM312 Lens -> should improve range
type 13120F2 should have same dimensions as 13120 with slightly improved range.
In that case the lenses work: use the original AM312 lens for the LED diffusor, get only one more 12130 lens for the light sensor, use the 023115 lens for the AM312.
